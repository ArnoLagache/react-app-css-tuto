# Context
The purpose of this project is to learn the basis of css throught the creation of react page/components.

Currently it contains two exercices :  
 - Structurate [predefined components](src/components/RestaurantComponents) to make a page that looks like : 
    ![](src/components/RestaurantComponents/FinalRenderExpected.jpg)
 - Update (custom components)[src/components/SpecificCaseComponents/] to override the default css of an antd component ([Table filter](https://ant.design/components/table)).

# Code Base
